**Software Writer**

I professionally write Ruby and Java for an company specializing in
software for Human Capital Management (HCM). Similar to [DHH's 2014
Rails Conf Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M), 
I consider myself a software writer, but will accept developer 
and--begrudgingly--engineer. I write code that communicates my intent
not only to a computer but also other developers.

**Activities**

Starting out riding only a few miles at a time and now I actively traing
for the annual [Mt. Acosta Classic](http://www.1stplacesports.com/mtacosta.html)
and the [Cherohalla Challenge](http://www.smwbikeclub.org/cherohala-challenge17/).
I also enjoy rock climbing, reading, debating ideas (culture and politics) and
a great glass of red wine.

**Organizations**

I've mentored with DanielKids, am involved with Toastmasters and am the
organizer for the local [RubyJax+ meetup](https://www.meetup.com/RubyJax/) group.

Last but not least, I'm a passionate libertarian. Much of my writing on
politics and culture stems from these ideas. Once upon a time I was a
staunch conservative. But many books, blogs, debates and thoughtful considerations
later and here I am, adding my voice to the arena of ideas, aiming to maximize
liberty for all.
